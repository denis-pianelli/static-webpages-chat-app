### What I learned

In this project, I developed a responsive and visually appealing user interface for a mobile chat application using HTML and CSS. The design incorporates gradient backgrounds, custom fonts, and carefully chosen color schemes to enhance the overall aesthetic. The chat interface includes message bubbles with distinct styling for received and sent messages, providing a clear visual distinction. Media queries ensure a seamless transition to a larger screen layout. Additionally, keyframe animations were implemented to introduce a dynamic element to the chat, making it more engaging. Through this project, I gained valuable experience in HTML structure, CSS styling, responsive design, and animation techniques.
